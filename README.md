# Homework #2 HTML&CSS

This project is part of the second homework.

## What Was Done

- Added HTML markup for the **Portfolio** section
- Optimized and added images to the `/images` folder
- Created the `/css` folder and `style.css` file
- Linked the CSS file to HTML via the `<link>` tag
- Connected required fonts as per the design
- Included `normalize.css` for cross-browser consistency
- Applied base styles for all sections
- Added semantic class names to HTML elements

## Note

All styles were implemented using **basic CSS only**, without Flexbox, as Flexbox will be covered in the next module.
